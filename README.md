# Week-2-Professional Profile

<b> DESCRIPTION </b>

Creates a website that can be used to as professional profile to display all my current programming projects.

The profile cotains a gallary of the projects and when clicked takes the end user of the progile to my github repo for that project.

It also contails my resume and contact ingormation.

The site is also responsive so when viewed on a smaller device it changes to meet the devices weidth requirments.

This has been achived via the use of flex box wrap and media queries.

The nav menu turns into a hamburger menu and I have made it interative by using css checkbox to hide or display the menu.
